# Shell Scripting

A beginner to shell scripting with a little knowledge about linux commands and familiarity with ubuntu linux. 
I use this repository to files and pictures uploaded from hands-on shell scripting practice. 
Big kudos to [linuxcommand.org](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_writing_shell_scripts.php) and [Kevin Stratvert](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinStratvert)!
